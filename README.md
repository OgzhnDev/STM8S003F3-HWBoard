# STM8S003F3-HWBoard
STM8 Development Board Project

This repository contains the design files and software for the STM8 Development Board. The hardware was designed in Altium, and the software library was developed to interface with the STM8 microcontroller.

This project was a collaborative effort. While I focused on the hardware design using Altium, the software library was developed by [baturyilmaz](https://github.com/baturyilmaz/STM8S003F3-EmbeddedCore).

This project marks my first foray into hardware design, and while I acknowledge the possibility of hardware errors, I am proud of the progress made and the learning experiences gained throughout this journey.
